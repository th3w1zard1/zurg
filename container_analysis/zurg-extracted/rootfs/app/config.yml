# List of directory definitions and their filtering rules
directories:
  # Configuration for anime shows
  anime:
    group: media # directories on different groups have duplicates of the same torrent
    group_order: 10 # group order = priority, it defines who eats first on a group
    filters:
      - and: # you can use nested 'and' & 'or' conditions
        - has_episodes: true # intelligent detection of episode files inside a torrent
        - any_file_inside_regex: /^\[/ # usually anime starts with [ e.g. [SubsPlease]
        - any_file_inside_not_regex: /s\d\de\d\d/i # and usually anime doesn't use SxxExx

  shows:
    group: media
    group_order: 20
    filters:
      - has_episodes: true  # intelligent detection of episode files inside a torrent

  movies:
    group: media  # because anime, shows and movies are in the same group,
    group_order: 30 # and anime and shows has a lower group_order number than movies, all torrents that doesn't fall into the previous 2 will fall into movies
    only_show_the_biggest_file: true # let's not show the other files besides the movie itself
    filters:
      - regex: /.*/ # you cannot leave a directory without filters because it will not have any torrents in it
